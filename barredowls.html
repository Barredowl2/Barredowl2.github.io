  <p> Barred owls are very large owls. The best habitat for a Barred owl is a mangrove. They are known for their call:
    "Who cooks for you?" sometimes followed by a "HOO-AW!". Their diet consists of crayfish, fish, rodents, and many other 
    things. Here is a video of a Barred owl being bonked on the head by a bird many times.</p>
